## **This is a CRUD using NodeJs and MongoDB**

Today we built a basic responsive app. Also we will explore some modules from Nodejs like *Express*, *Handlebars*, *Babel*, *Moongose*, and some others.
Also we will make a raw frontend where we can also listen to some events.

### Enviroment Variables:  In order for this application to work you should declare the next variables:

*MONGODB_URI* <br>
